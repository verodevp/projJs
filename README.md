# projJs Test your patience: Guess the number from 1 to 10
Hi! This is my first JavaScript project. It's a simple application where there are two players: the user and  the machine. 

## How it works

The user must guess the number launched by the machine computer.

A random number is extracted via the button “play”, then the user will choose his number by clicking the increment or decrease button, then he will send the choice trough the button "send".

If the number is matched, the player gets a point, otherwise, the score will be assigned to the machine.

## Prerequisites
